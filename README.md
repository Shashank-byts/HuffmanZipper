HuffmanZipper is a lightweight file compression tool implemented in C++.
It uses Huffman Coding to generate optimal prefix-free binary codes based on
character frequency, enabling efficient compression of text or binary files.
Features include:

• Huffman tree construction using priority queues  
• Bit-level encoding and decoding  
• Support for custom file extensions (.huff)  
• Automatic compression ratio calculation  
• Fast decompression using tree traversal

Achieves 40–60% file size reduction on average.
